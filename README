PyClutter
=========

This archive contains the Python modules that allow you to use the
Clutter toolkit in Python programs.

If you have any enhancements of bug reports, please file them in
OpenedHand Bugzilla at:

  http://bugzilla.o-hand.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Clutter

Requirements
------------
  * GLib 2.16.0 or higher
  * GTK+ 2.10.0 or higher
  * Clutter 1.0.0 or higher
  * PyCairo 1.0.2 or higher
  * PyGObject 2.21.3 or higher
  * Python 2.6.0 or higher

Installation
------------

In order to install this module type the following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

To avoid installing to a system directory you can change the installation
prefix at configure time with

  ./configure --prefix=/some/other/place

Release notes for PyClutter 1.0.0
---------------------------------

The cluttercairo submodule has been removed, since all of its functionaly
is now available inside the core clutter module.

The cluttergst and cluttergtk submodules have been moved out of the
pyclutter tree and they now have their own repositories:

  git://git.clutter-project.org/bindings/pyclutter-gst
  git://git.clutter-project.org/bindings/pyclutter-gtk

Release notes for PyClutter 0.8.2
---------------------------------

The units-based API for clutter.Actor now accepts only floating point
values to express the same sub-pixel precision that the C core library
implements using the ClutterUnit type.

This change will unfortunately break every Python application using the
units-based API and currently passing values using the Pytho bindings
for the conversion to and from units.

Release notes for PyClutter 0.8.0
---------------------------------

The cluttercairo, cluttergst and cluttergtk submodules of clutter have
been moved into their own modules. In order to import them, the import
directive must be changed from:

        from clutter import cluttercairo
        from clutter import cluttergst
        from clutter import cluttergtk

to:

        import cluttercairo
        import cluttergst
        import cluttergtk

The order of the import directives is also relevant, because of the
required initialization process of the underlying C libraries. The
correct order for importing the clutter and related modules is:

        first ↑
              | import cluttergtk
              | import cluttergst
              | import clutter
              | import cluttercairo
         last ↓

If you are importing the gst module, you must import it after the
cluttergst module.

If you are importing the gtk module, you must import it after the
cluttergtk module.
