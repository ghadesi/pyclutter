Updating bindings to the latest release
=======================================

* Install latest clutter with --prefix=/opt

* Enter in pyclutter

* Run:
        /usr/share/pygtk/2.0/codegen/h2def.py \
                -m clutter \
                -f clutter/clutter-base.defs \
                -s clutter/clutter-<version> \
        /opt/include/clutter-<version>/clutter/*.h

* This command will leave two files:
        clutter-<version>.defs
        clutter-<version>-types.defs
  The former contains the new methods and functions definitions; the
  latter contains the new types definitions.

* Check the content, and remember that h2def.py lies and it's a buggy
  piece of code.

* Merge the files with the clutter-base.defs and clutter-base-types.defs.

* If you want to support a development release of clutter, you'll need
  to add a check in the configure.ac, define a conditional, and tell
  the codegen to append the new .defs files if the conditional is
  set to true.
