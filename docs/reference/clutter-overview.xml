  <para>Clutter is a GObject based library for creating fast, visually rich 
    graphical user interfaces.</para>
  <para>Clutter semantics work by having a stage (a window) and then adding 
    actors (widgets) to the stage and manipulating via the actor api. Actors 
    can contain child actors (ClutterGroup for example) and be manipulated 
    as a whole.</para>
  <para>Animations and visual effects can be created via the use of timelines 
    and behaviours. Timelines provide accurate frame based animations. 
    Behaviours further extend this by taking a timeline, a control function 
    (<link linkend="class-clutteralpha"><classname>clutter.Alpha</classname></link>) 
    and then applying to actors as to modify a property as a function of time.</para>
