Overview of changes between 0.4.2 and 0.5.0
===========================================

* Resync with upstream
  o Removed the clutter.Layout, clutter.Box, clutter.HBox and clutter.VBox
    classes, as upstream removed them as well
  o The clutter.Margin and clutter.Padding classes have been removed as
    well
  o Add clutter.Score, clutter.Shader, clutter.Model and clutter.Script
  o Various API changes
* Change the clutter.Actor.do_query_coords() method signature: an ActorBox
  is also passed to the method, containing the current bounding box
  coordinates
* The alpha parameter in the clutter.Behaviour classes has been moved at
  the end of the arguments list, to reflect its being optional; named
  arguments still work and are the safest way to call constructors
* The clutter.Texture constructor accepts an optional pixbuf argument;
  this removes the need of clutter.texture_from_pixbuf() function
* clutter.ActorBox has two new fields: .size and .origin returning tuples
* Fixed bugs:
  o #622 - Segmentation fault when calling Entry.handle_key_event()
