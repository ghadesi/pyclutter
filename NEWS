Overview of changes between 0.6.0 and 0.6.2
===========================================

* Require clutter-core >= 0.6.2
* Require Python >= 2.4.0
* Fix bug #841 - override the dlopen() flags to allow loading
  symbols from the underlying C libraries [Blake Ramsdell]
* Add more documentation
* Fix the BehaviourEllipse constructor to follow the same
  pattern of the other behaviours
* Fix the clutter.tidy optional module

Overview of changes between 0.5.2 and 0.6.0
===========================================

* Require clutter-core >= 0.6.0
* Require 0.6 releases of the whole clutter suite
* Add optional Tidy bindings (not enabled by default)
* Resync with upstream changes
* Add deprecation warnings
* Fix bug #797 - Memory leak with pyclutter [Tero Saarni]

Overview of changes between 0.5.1 and 0.5.2
===========================================

* Require clutter-core >= 0.5.6
* Resync with upstream changes
* Add initial API reference [bug #758, Daniel Schierbeck]
* Deprecated clutter.rectangle_new_with_color(): pass the "color" (optional)
  parameter to clutter.Rectangle() instead
* Deprecated clutter.stage_get_default(): call clutter.Stage() instead
* Let pyclutter pick up clutter.Script.connect_signals()
* The parameters of clutter.Score.append() have been inverted with regards
  to the C API; the new signature is: clutter.Score.append(timeline, parent).
  Named parameters will still work.
* Fix bug #748 - typo in clutter.Event.modifier_state

Overview of changes between 0.5.0 and 0.5.1
===========================================

* Require autotools >= 1.9
* Require clutter-core >= 0.5.4 and clutter-gtk >= 0.5.2
* Resync with upstream changes
* Support the conversion to and from ClutterUnits
* Allow the duration property of clutter.Timeline as a constructor parameter,
  and remove clutter.timeline_new_for_duration()

Overview of changes between 0.4.2 and 0.5.0
===========================================

* Resync with upstream
  o Removed the clutter.Layout, clutter.Box, clutter.HBox and clutter.VBox
    classes, as upstream removed them as well
  o The clutter.Margin and clutter.Padding classes have been removed as
    well
  o Add clutter.Score, clutter.Shader, clutter.Model and clutter.Script
  o Various API changes
* Change the clutter.Actor.do_query_coords() method signature: an ActorBox
  is also passed to the method, containing the current bounding box
  coordinates
* The alpha parameter in the clutter.Behaviour classes has been moved at
  the end of the arguments list, to reflect its being optional; named
  arguments still work and are the safest way to call constructors
* The clutter.Texture constructor accepts an optional pixbuf argument;
  this removes the need of clutter.texture_from_pixbuf() function
* clutter.ActorBox has two new fields: .size and .origin returning tuples
* Fixed bugs:
  o #622 - Segmentation fault when calling Entry.handle_key_event()

Overview of changes between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0
===========================================

* Resync with upstream

* Resync with upstream
  o add clutter.Behaviour API
  o allow implementing a clutter.Behaviour in pure python
  o add clutter.Alpha API
  o allow implementing the clutter.Media interface in pure python
* Clean up the build environment
  o split overridden functions per object/function
  o add clutter.gtk and clutter.gst sub-modules
  o add some public API for bindings of clutter-based libraries
