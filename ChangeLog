2008-02-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Rename --enable-doc to --enable-docs, and
	default it to "no" when building a developers snapshot.

2008-02-07  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* examples/script.py: Add more checks.

2008-02-07  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.override: Let pyclutter pick up
	clutter.Script.connect_signals()

	* clutter/clutter.override: Override clutter.Score.append()
	so that the optional parent goes at the end of the arguments
	tuple.

	* examples/script.py: Add an example of clutter.Script.

2008-02-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add the new move_anchor_point()
	and move_anchor_point_from_gravity() methods.

	* docs/Makefile.am: Fix indentation for the pdf generation; it
	still doesn't quite work, unfortunately.
	
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/test-scale.py: Add test-scale.py, exercising the
	scale behaviour and the anchor point API

	* examples/behave.py:
	* examples/cairo-texture.py:
	* examples/rects.py:
	* examples/super-oh.py:
	* examples/videosink.py: Update to clutter.Stage().

2008-02-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am: Fix the fixxref call.

	* docs/reference/clutter-clutteractor.xml:
	* docs/reference/clutter-cluttercolor.xml:
	* docs/reference/clutter-overview.xml:
	* docs/reference/clutter-ref.xml: More documentation: add the
	overview from Clutter core and more descriptions on methods
	properties and signals. (Daniel Schierbeck) 

2008-02-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs:
	* clutter/clutter.override: Wrap clutter_stage_get_default()
	as clutter.Stage(), so that it feels more pythonic. The
	current clutter.stage_get_default() function is still there
	for compatibility, but it should probably go away before 0.6.0.

	* examples/hello.py: Update to test.

2008-02-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	* docs/Makefile.am: Add build environment for the pyclutter
	documentation. (#758, Daniel Schierbeck)

	* docs/reference/clutter-clutteractor.xml:
	* docs/reference/clutter-cluttercolor.xml:
	* docs/reference/clutter-ref.xml: Add initial XML files for
	the documentation; needs work, so patches accepted.

2008-02-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Remove clutter_actor_apply_shader()
	and bind:

	  clutter_actor_set_shader()
	  clutter_actor_get_shader()

2008-02-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Update after upstream API changes
	in clutter.Entry, clutter.BehaviourScale and
	clutter.effect_scale. (based on a patch by Kashyap Ashwin)

	* clutter/clutter-effect.override: Update clutter.effect_scale
	and initialise all the optional arguments of the effects API
	to Py_None, to avoid segfaults. (based on a patch by Tero Saarni)

2008-01-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Require stable releases of clutter-core and
	clutter-gtk.

	* README:
	* NEWS: Release 0.5.1

2008-01-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* autogen.sh:
	* configure.ac: Require autotools >= 1.9 and clutter-gtk >= 0.5.1

	* clutter-gtk/cluttergtk.defs:
	* clutter-gtk/cluttergtk.override:
	* clutter-gtk/cluttergtkmodule.c: Update after upstream changes
	in the clutter-gtk integration library. No API changes for the
	Python bindings.

2008-01-22  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add BehaviourDepth and BehaviourOpacity
	new methods.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Override the get_bounds()
	methods of BehaviourDepth() and BehaviourOpacity()

	* examples/behave.py: Remove the scale behaviour, as it was
	just cluttering up.

2008-01-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Fix a typo in the set_gravity()
	method definition of clutter.BehaviourScale.

2008-01-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override:
	* clutter/clutter-effect.override: Update for the upstream API
	change in ClutterBehaviourScale and clutter_effect_scale()

	* configure.ac: Require Clutter core 0.5.3.

2008-01-10  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add function wrappers for the newly
	defined CLUTTER_UNITS_* macros.

2008-01-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: All the constructor parameters for
	clutter.Timeline are optional (we provide sane defaults); add
	the duration property, so you can do clutter.Timeline(duration=1000).

	* clutter/clutter.override: Ignore clutter.timeline_new_for_duration()
	as now clutter.Timeline also takes the duration argument.

	* examples/behave.py: Update to show the construction of timelines
	in the time domain, instead of the frames domain.

2008-01-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-base.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-model.override: Rename clutter.ModelDefault
	into clutter.ListModel, following the upstream change.

	* README:
	* configure.ac: Update requirements.

2008-01-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Post-release bump to 0.5.1

2008-01-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* NEWS:
	* README: Release 0.5.0

2008-01-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-boxed.override: Add the .origin and .size
	read-only fields to clutter.ActorBox.

2008-01-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.override: As discovered in the Perl
	bindings, the box argument in clutter.Actor.do_query_coords()
	overridable method is an in-out parameter: instances are
	supposed to get an ActorBox with the current coordinates and
	return a tuple containing the coordinates of the new bounding
	box.

2008-01-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add ClutterModelDefault type and
	definitions.

	* clutter/clutter-model.override: Bind:

		clutter.Model.append()
		clutter.Model.prepend()
		clutter.Model.insert()

	and fix a couple of signed/unsigned casts.

2008-01-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-model.override: Update after API changes upstream:
	clutter.Model() becomes clutter.ModelDefault(); implement
	clutter.ModelIter.set() and clutter.ModelIter.get(); stub out
	clutter.Model insert, append and prepend methods; implement
	clutter.Model.foreach(), clutter.Model.set_sort() and
	clutter.Model.set_filter().

	* clutter/clutter.override: Fix GList->GSList usage.

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-model.override: Bind clutter.Model.set_types()
	and clutter.Model.set_names().

	* clutter/clutter-script.override: Ignore the ClutterScriptable
	interface methods: they are used only by the clutter.Script class
	and are not meant for external usage.

	* clutter/clutter.override: Bind clutter.Score.list_timelines().

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Declare the constructors for many
	types using the new format (properties instead of parameters);
	this allows the autogeneration to work for us. The clutter.Texture
	constructor now accepts an optional pixbuf parameter, so
	clutter.texture_new_from_pixbuf() has been removed in favour of
	a more pythonic:

	  try:
	      from gtk import gdk
	      tex = clutter.Texture(gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file("redhand.png"))
	  except Exception:
	      print "Unable to create texture from redhand.png"
	      sys.exit(1)

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Remove the overridden
	constructors for clutter.BehaviourDepth, clutter.BehaviourOpacity,
	clutter.BehaviourRotate and clutter.BehaviourScale, and use the
	autogenerated ones. This implies a subtle API break: the alpha
	argument now goes at the end of the list of parameters; to avoid
	breakage, the named argument passing is preferred. E.g.:

	  clutter.BehaviourDepth(alpha, -100, 0)
	
	becomes:

	  clutter.BehaviourDepth(-100, 0, alpha)

	or, better:

	  clutter.BehaviourDepht(depth_start=-100, depth_end=0, alpha=alpha)

	* examples/super-oh.py:
	* examples/hello.py:
	* examples/behave.py: Update with the new constructor syntax

	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/videosink.py: Add a cluttergst.VideoSink example, written
	by Florent Thiery.

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.override: Mark the gravity parameter in
	clutter.effect_scale() and the direction parameter in
	clutter.effect_rotate() as optional, as they have a default value.

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter.override: Ignore clutter.texture_new_from_pixbuf();
	implement clutter.Timeline.get_delta().

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.override: Fix coding style.

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* examples/cairo-texture.py: Update API usage.

2008-01-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* examples/super-oh.py: Fix the super-oh example and update the
	API usage.

2008-01-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter.override: Avoid a segfault un the
	clutter.Entry.handle_key_event(). (#622)

2008-01-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Update after the
	properties naming changes upstream.

	* clutter/clutter-effect.override: Mark the constructor for
	clutter.EffectTemplate as a new-style one.

	* examples/behave.py: Update after API changes

2008-01-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Remove the fixed point
	variants as we now don't even have them in the defs files;
	rename clutter.BehaviourBspline.append() to append_knots().

	* clutter/clutter-effect.override: Ignore the construct()
	method; implement clutter.Effect.rotate(), using a 3-element
	tuple for the rotation center.

	* clutter/clutter.override: Remove more fixed point ignored
	API; remove the old clutter.Box wrappers.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.override: Remove even mode fixed point
	ignored API; implement clutter.Actor.get_anchor_point()

2008-01-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Update with the latest API additions.

2008-01-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-model.override: Fix the constructor.

	* clutter/clutter.override: Add more checks in the handle_key_event()
	method of clutter.Entry.

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Remove and rename a couple of methods,
	just enough to make pyclutter build.

2007-11-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.override: Ignore ClutterScript
	connect_signals_full() method.

2007-11-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter.override: Ignore the threads idle/timeout
	convenience API: we need to release the python lock when
	holding the clutter one, and we cannot do that without
	reimplementing the convienience API altogether.

2007-11-28  Emmanuele Bassi <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.override: Overrides for the
	clutter-effect API.

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.override: Build glue for clutter-effect
	overrides.

	* clutter/pyclutter.[ch]: Add pyclutter_effect_complete().

2007-11-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Remove get_progressx()
	definition from ClutterTimline.

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.override: Build glue for ClutterModel
	overrides.

	* clutter/clutter-model.override: Initial stabe at the
	overrides for ClutterModel.

2007-11-27  Emmanuele Bassi <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add clutter-script.override

	* clutter/clutter-script.override: Overrides for using
	ClutterScript within python: get_objects() returns a list
	of objects, while connect_signals() will connect python
	callable objects found in the current namespace.

	* clutter/clutter.override: Include clutter-script.override

2007-11-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	API from the definitions.

2007-11-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Initial work at porting the PyClutter bindings to the
	API in trunk. this is going to be some overhaul, so please
	be patient.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.override: Add [sg]et_rotation() API

	* clutter/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Start pruning all the definitions
	that have been removed/are to be removed from upstream.

	* clutter/clutter-boxed.override: Ditto as above.

	* clutter/clutter-event.override: Add ClutterEventCrossing and
	make the event code a little more generic.

	* clutter/pyclutter.[ch]: Remove C utility functions for the
	types that have been removed.

	* py-compile: Do not put py-compile under revision control.

2007-09-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Initialise the ctor
	parameters for every clutter.Behaviour; now it's possible
	to create any behaviour instance without passing any parameter
	to the constructors and change the parameters later on,
	without having the python bindings segfault.

2007-09-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Do not segfault when
	an invalid number of arguments is passed to the various
	behaviours constructors. (#506, Giuliani Vito Ivan)

2007-09-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.override: Initialise the value of
	the color components, so that clutter.Color() does the

2007-09-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Merge from pyclutter-0-4

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Add more sanity checks
	on the arguments passed to the alpha functions.

2007-09-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* examples/redhand.png: Add the SuperOH example; ported from
	the original C source by Paul Cooper.

2007-09-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Fix up the names of the
	properties in the clutter.BehaviourDepth constructor.

2007-08-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Bump up to 0.5.0 and require development branches
	for all the modules.

2007-08-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-boxed.override: Fix clutter.Margin() and
	clutter.Padding() constructors.

	* clutter/clutter-event.override: Ignore clutter_event_copy()
	and clutter_event_free(), as we're not supposed to pass events
	as boxed types.

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add fake constructors for
	clutter.ActorBox, clutter.Margin and clutter.Padding.

2007-08-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* NEWS: Update and release 0.4.0 (see svn log for details).

2007-03-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter-gst/cluttergst.override:
	* clutter-gst/cluttergstmodule.c:
	* clutter-gst/Makefile.am: Update clutter.gst module for
	the ClutterGst library.

	* Makefile.am:

	* examples/behave.py: Add BehaviourScale object.

2006-12-22  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* pyclutter.doap:
	Fix so parse-able.

2006-12-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter.override: Override clutter_label_set_color()
	to use the tuple/object color API like the stage and rectangle
	actors.

2006-12-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Add more checks and
	decrement reference count of the right objects.

	* clutter/pyclutter.c: Do not decrement the reference count
	of the callback arguments tuple after we're done with it,
	and let the garbage collector do its thing (fixes a reference
	counting bug in the alpha notify function).

2006-12-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/keysyms.py: Add the key symbols list, and use the
	pygtk lazy loading facility (currently, calls gtk._lazyutils
	but might be useful to install our own copy?) to load what's
	needed only when it's needed.

2006-12-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add the ClutterMedia virtual
	functions, so that you can implement the ClutterMedia
	interface in pure python.

2006-12-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* examples/rects.py:
	* examples/behave.py: Update examples code.

2006-12-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-boxed.override: Remove the ClutterColor
	overridden methods here and put them into clutter-color.override.

	* clutter/pyclutter.h:
	* clutter/pyclutter.c: Allow conversion from a 4-tuple to
	a ClutterColor; this is a shortcut for functions taking only
	a single color parameter, but must be explicitely overridden
	to allow this behaviour.

	* clutter/clutter-color.override: Put everything concerning
	ClutterColor here; wrap ClutterColor into its own boxed type
	to avoid having to reimplement color-related functions for
	three types of data (integers, tuples and dictionaries); now
	to create a color use clutter.Color(red,green,blue,alpha)
	like pygtk; wrap color_from_hls() and color_from_pixel() as
	package functions; wrap to_hls(), to_pixel(), shade(),
	darken() and lighten() as instance methods.

	* clutter/clutter.override: Include clutter-color.override;
	update overridden color setters and color getters.

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs:
	* clutter/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* clutter/Makefile.am: Update build and codegen glue.

	* examples/rects.py:
	* examples/behave.py: Update examples.

2006-12-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter.override: Update the rest of the clutter
	color API to accept tuples, except clutter.color_from_hls()
	which will accept a tuple, a dictionary or three integers.

2006-12-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* examples/rects.py:
	* examples/behave.py: Update examples.

2006-12-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add clutter_feature_available(),
	clutter_color_equal(), clutter_actor_show_all() and
	clutter_actor_hide_all().

	* clutter/clutter.override: Provide the correct implementation
	of clutter.color_parse(); ignore clutter_color_equal(), as
	python already has an equality test for tuples; allow passing
	a tuple instead of a tuple of args to clutter.Stage.set_color()
	and clutter.Rectangle.set_color(): now we can use the

		stage.set_color(clutter.color_parse('DarkSlateGray'))
	
	idiomatic construct and everything will work as expected; this
	breaks backward compatibility: you *must* pass a tuple, not
	four arguments.

2006-12-12  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Add more checks in the
	do_alpha_notify caller; fix a reference count bug: the alpha
	value python object got unreffed twice.

2006-12-11  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Check for a callable
	function inside the clutter.Alpha constructor; wrap the
	clutter.Behaviour.get_actors() method; override the alpha_notify
	virtual method and proxy, and allow the creation of pure
	python behaviours.

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add missing methods.

	* clutter/pyclutter.c: Add some checks; use PyObject_CallObject()
	instead of the generic PyObject_Call(): should be a bit faster.

	* examples/behave.py: Add an example of a pure python behaviour.

2006-12-11  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/pyclutter.h:
	* clutter/pyclutter.c: Use a better callback mechanism
	for the invocation of callable functions; still rough,
	and needs type checking on the parameters.  one might
	wonder why pygobject bindings don't provide such mechanism
	in the first place.  machinery heavily borrowed from the
	perl bindings.

	* clutter/clutter.override:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Update PyClutterCallback
	usage.

	* examples/behave.py: Add another behaviour for testing.

2006-12-07  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-base.defs: Add declaration for the
	vfunc ClutterBehaviour::alpha_notify; now you can
	subclass clutter.Behaviour and override do_alpha_notify
	to create a pure python behaviour.

	* clutter/clutterpython.c:
	* clutter/pyclutter.c: Rename the helper utils code.

	* Makefile.am: Update with the renamed helper file.

	* clutter-gst/clutter-gst.defs:
	* clutter-gst/clutter-gst-types.defs: Add defs file
	for the clutter-gst sub-module.

	* configure.ac:
	* Makfile.am: Add support for the sub-modules; use the
	--with-clutter-gtk and --with-clutter-gst configure
	switch to enable their compilation; fixed the --enable-doc
	switch.

	* clutter-gst/Makefile.am:
	* clutter-gtk/Makefile.am: Build glue for the sub-modules.

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Add.

2006-12-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Ignore the single
	knot clutter_behaviour_path_append_knot(): we have append_knots();
	add more type error checking inside both the BehaviourPath
	constructor and append_knots(): we accepts only tuples of
	pairs, as a knot is immutable once inside the path.

	* examples/behave.py: Add a append_knots() call to test it.

		clutter.Rectangle.set_border_color
		clutter.Rectangle.get_border_width
		clutter.Rectangle.set_border_width
	
	use the new style for constructors

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Update the clutter.Alpha
	constructor to accept a function and a timeline as optional
	arguments; override the clutter.BehaviourPath constructor to
	accept a tuple of (x, y) pairs as knots.

	* clutter/clutterpython.c: Use the right object as the caller.

	* clutter/__init__.py: Relay the MAX_ALPHA C macro as a module
	variable; provide pure python implementations of the alpha
	functions.

	* docs/update-bindings.txt: Add a checklist for updating the
	bindings when upstream changes.

	* configure.ac: Add a check for building docs if xsltproc is
	available; now all that's left to do is to use the pygtk
	xslt and write the docs.

	* examples/behave.py: Simple porting of the upstream behave
	example program.

2006-11-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	to pyclutter_callback_invoke(): use this argument to change
	the caller (i.e. the first argument) of the callback from the
	default (the instance of the class).

	* clutter/clutter.override: Implement clutter.Group.foreach().

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Implement the

	directory variable.

	* clutter/pyclutter.h:
	* clutter/clutterpython.c: Utility header for easier bindings;
	added PyClutterCallback, a wrapper for invoking callbacks; this
	should really go into pygtk, though - luckily for us, the Perl
	bindings are more friendly.

	* clutter/cluttermodule.c: Update with the correct prefix.

	* clutter/clutter.override:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.override: Implement the
	missing clutter.Alpha.set_func() method using the newly

	* clutter/clutter.override:
	* clutter/clutter-base.defs:

2006-06-06  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* python/clutter-base.defs:
	Add support for set/get_depth. Fix timeline declaration.

2006-06-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* python/clutter-base-types.defs:
	* python/clutter-base.defs:
	* python/clutter.override: Wrap new API and objects.

2006-05-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* python/clutter-base.defs: Make static functions appear like
	package methods, e.g.: clutter_main() is clutter.main() and
	not clutter.clutter_main().  Changed functions are:
	    C name			  Python name
	  - clutter_main		- clutter.main
	  - clutter_stage		- clutter.stage
	  - clutter_want_debug		- clutter.want_debug
	  - clutter_redraw		- clutter.redraw
	  - clutter_threads_enter	- clutter.threads_enter
	  - clutter_threads_leave	- clutter.threads_leave
	
	* python/clutter.override: Ignore all X11 and GL related
	functions, as we don't have type definitions for them; fix typos
	and cut-and-paste errors; make the threads_enter and main static
	function use the pygobject threading facilities.

	* Makefile.am: Rework the build system.  The defs files have been
	split in two: clutter-base-types.def for the type declarations
	and clutter-base.defs for the methods and functions.  The python
	glue code depends on two auto-generated files: clutter.defs and
	clutter-types.defs; these two files includes the clutter-base
	files.  If the API changes, run "make update-defs": it will
	create a "clutter-api.defs" which should be hand-edited and
	the new sections added to the clutter-base files.  This is needed
	because we do some mangling of the namespace and static functions
	names, so we can't rely on the h2defs generator.

2006-05-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	API coverage:
	  - global functions: 71.43% (10/14)
	  - methods:          95.40% (83/87)

	ClutterTexture methods:
	  - get_base_size
	  - get_n_tiles

	  - get_y_tile_detail
	
	* python/clutter.override: Implement the ClutterGroup.add_many
	method.
